    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "You will perform a statistical analysis to establish whether race has a significant impact on the rate of callbacks for resumes.\n",

    "   1. What test is appropriate for this problem? Does CLT apply?\n",
    "   2. What are the null and alternate hypotheses?\n",
    "   3. Compute margin of error, confidence interval, and p-value.\n",
    "   4. Write a story describing the statistical significance in the context or the original problem.\n",
    "   5. Does your analysis mean that race/name is the most important factor in callback success? Why or why not? If not, how would you amend your analysis?\n",

    "We ran the calculations using two tests: 2 proportion z-test and 2 sample z test. They were very slightly different, and yielded nearly identical results. However, in this case, the 2 proportion z test is the appropriate one to use. The final conclusion is:\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence Interval: (0.0167509418986,0.0473147665203) we are 95% sure that there is a 1.675% to 4.731% significant difference between white and black call back success rates. Keep in mind, the black mean callback was only 6.45% and the white was 9.65%, so this confidence interval represents significant change. In the worst case, for black applicants, 6.45% - 4.731% is 1.719%, which is a dramatic -73.35% change. At best, the percent change from 6.45% to 4.775% is a - 26% change. So the practical confidence interval we are observing with this data set is that: \"We are 95% that the difference between being black and being white attributes to a reduced chance of receiving a callback by 26% to 73.35% for black applicants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Z-Value and P-Test: The z-value was calculated as 4.108, which greatly exceeds the critical z-value of 1.96. Practically speaking, we can see that this shows a deviation from the mean of the normal distribution of the Null Hypothesis that the observed difference between black and white callback success rates is equal to 4.108 standard deviations. The chance for that to happen is .003984%, which is extremely unlikely and therefore we can reject the null hypothesis under 95% certainty. Unfortunately, this data supports the claim that there are significant signs of racial prejudice by hiring managers. Perhaps this is because they are reading the applications behind a computer screen, and not face to face with their applicant. It is very easy to say \"No\" to an applicant, and that means that even something as simple as having a \"black sounding name\" can be enough to trigger a racial bias within the hiring manager resulting in turning down the application.

    "My analysis does not mean that race/name is the most important factor in callback success because there are also many other factors at play. For example, a \"black sounding name\" on a resume with a PhD has undoubtedly drastically increased qualifications over a resume with a bachelor's. I believe that first, the qualifications must be met, then the race may play a factor once there are two or more applicants who are similar in qualifications (assuming a racist hiring manager). If the qualifications are handily met by an applicant, race would probably not play a big role in their hiring besides in cases of extreme racism. I would like to see an analysis breaking down regionally where the \"black name resumes\" were declined most significantly on a heat map. That would add a layer of depth to explore the root of the racial discrimination within our nation. \n",
